#### Responsive Page Exercise

  Please see the screen capture file `responsive_css.mov` to see how the page responds to changes in window size. I've been having some problems with my mic so I was not able to narrate over the video.

  At the beginning of the video, note that the window width is measured at 1275px. I have set the max width of the page to be 1150px and centered it on the window, creating the whitespace on either side.

  At a window width of 664px, the CSS transitions to the more mobile friendly orientation.

  Given the simplicity of the assignment, I didn't use SASS, but I can transition this code to SASS/Compass if that is something you are looking for.
